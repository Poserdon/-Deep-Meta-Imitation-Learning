# Deep-Meta-Imitation-Learning
Abstract: Despite the significant potential demonstrated by deep learning technology in industrial applications, it still faces challenges such as high data demands, limited generalization capabilities, and issues with safety and stability. These challenges are particularly pronounced when mobile robotic arms are tasked with precisely opening multiple button-locked cabinet doors in substation environments, involving complex environmental perception, dynamically changing operational settings, high stability requirements, and tests of generalization ability. To address these challenges, this study introduces the Deep Meta-Imitation Learning (DMIL) algorithm, which combines deep meta-learning with imitation learning techniques to enhance the adaptability and efficiency of mobile robotic arms in such tasks. Expert trajectories were generated and evaluated in the CoppeliaSim simulation environment, and real-world interactions were assessed. This study utilized a 6D pose estimation method from deep learning to determine the position and orientation of the button locks, identifying key operational points as visual guides. During the imitation learning phase, the operational strategy of the robotic arm was optimized by integrating Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL) and Variable Impedance Control (VIC) technologies with expert trajectories and real-world force feedback data. Additionally, the introduction of Latent Embedding Optimization (LEO) within the deep meta-learning framework enabled the system to rapidly adapt to new tasks, significantly enhancing the model's generalization capabilities. Experiments were conducted in both the CoppeliaSim simulation environment and on a mobile robotic arm platform, testing identification, trajectory generation, and compliance control. Three different button lock cabinet door opening tasks of varying difficulty levels were set up to assess the algorithm's performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the mobile robotic arm can effectively locate and open multiple button locks, showcasing the potential and practicality of this method in industrial automation and robotics technology.
